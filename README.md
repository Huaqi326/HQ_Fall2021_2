My name is Huaqi Zhang. My major is computer science, and my minor is art studio. I have taken computer science 1, 2, and 3, assembly language & computer architecture, object-oriented programming, software engineering, discrete & continuous computer algorithms, language processing. I did a demo game with three classmates by Unity in the software engineering class. This summer, I had an internship and learn some experiences in Typescript and SCSS by using React, youmaker.com is the project I did this summer. I did the front-end tasks. I improved search input, category bar, category page, banner problems, sidebar language selector button, and separate language page with different URLs. I also create an empty playlist page, comment sort button, share channel playlist button.

I hope I can learn back-end knowledge and more knowledge about front-end. I will use what I have learned in my future work. I am very excited about the project we will do this semester. I may try to create my own website by using what we learn in this class, I think it will be cool.
